**Difficulty**: Hard (needs workspace integration)
**Impact**: Very High

---

### üîç Code Intelligence

#### 13. Enhanced File Picker
**What**: Better file selection with:
- Fuzzy search
- Recently used files
- Git status indicators (modified, staged)
- File size warnings
**Why**: Current picker is basic
**Difficulty**: Hard (replace native UI component)
**Impact**: High

#### 14. Smart Context Detection
**What**: Auto-include files based on imports/requires
**Why**: "You're editing auth.js, want authMiddleware.js too?"
**Difficulty**: Very Hard (static analysis needed)
**Impact**: Very High

#### 15. Diff Viewer Integration
**What**: Show git diff inline before sending to Claude
**Why**: "Review these 10 files - are you sure?"
**Difficulty**: Medium (git integration exists in VSCode)
**Impact**: Medium

---

### üõ°Ô∏è Safety & Quality

#### 16. Approval Whitelist
**What**: Bypass mode, but prompt for dangerous commands:
- `rm -rf`
- `git push --force`
- File deletions
**Why**: Safety without annoying prompts
**Difficulty**: Medium (command parsing)
**Impact**: High

#### 17. Undo Stack
**What**: "Undo last 3 changes Claude made"
**Why**: Easy rollback when Claude messes up
**Difficulty**: Very Hard (track all file modifications)
**Impact**: Very High

#### 18. Change Preview
**What**: Show diff before applying edits
**Why**: Review before committing
**Difficulty**: Medium (use VSCode diff API)
**Impact**: High

---

### üîß Advanced Features

#### 19. Custom System Prompts
**What**: Override default Claude behavior per workspace
**Why**: "Always use TypeScript", "Prefer functional style"
**Difficulty**: Medium (need to modify request payload)
**Impact**: High

#### 20. Tool Call Inspector
**What**: Live view of what tools Claude is calling
**Why**: Debug, understand what's happening
**Difficulty**: Medium (intercept and display tool calls)
**Impact**: Medium

#### 21. Response Streaming Control
**What**: Pause/resume Claude mid-response
**Why**: "Wait, stop, I need to check something"
**Difficulty**: Hard (control streaming API)
**Impact**: Medium

#### 22. Multi-Model Support
**What**: Quick switch between Sonnet/Opus/Haiku mid-conversation

**Difficulty**: Medium-Hard (modify API calls)
**Impact**: High

## How to Contribute

### For Users
1. **Vote**: Comment on features you want most
2. **Suggest**: Open issues with new ideas
3. **Test**: Try patches and report bugs

### For Developers
1. **Start small**: Pick an "Easy" difficulty feature
2. **Study existing code**: See how we patch CSS/JS
3. **Fork & PR**: Add your feature, submit PR
4. **Document**: Update CLAUDE.md with new patches

### For Everyone
**Share this project!** The more users request features, the more likely Anthropic will add them natively. That's how we won with bypass mode.

---

## Development Philosophy

**Our proven approach**:
```
1. Identify missing feature
2. Build it as an extension patcher
3. Make it resilient (regex patterns, stable selectors)
4. Gather user feedback
5. Prove the demand
6. Hope Anthropic adds it natively
7. Celebrate victory üéâ
8. Move to next feature
```

**Why this works**:
- Low barrier to entry (bash script)
- Fast iteration (no need to build full extension)
- Demonstrates feasibility to Anthropic
- Users get features NOW, not "in 6 months"

## Technical Feasibility Notes

### Easy Patches
- **CSS modifications**: Color themes, fonts, spacing
- **String replacements**: Button labels, tooltips
- **Simple injections**: Small HTML/CSS additions

### Medium Patches
- **UI component injection**: New buttons, widgets
- **Event listeners**: Keyboard shortcuts
- **Local storage**: Saving preferences, sessions
- **Regex patterns**: Command filtering, parsing

### Hard Patches
- **API interception**: Modify requests/responses
- **State management**: Complex feature state
- **Multi-file coordination**: Tracking changes across files
- **Persistent data structures**: Indexing, caching

### Very Hard Patches
- **Static analysis**: Understanding code semantics
- **Undo/redo system**: Reliable change tracking
- **Streaming control**: Pause/resume API responses
- **Full UI replacement**: Replace native components

## Next Steps

1. **Community poll**: Which feature should we build first?
2. **Create issues**: One issue per feature for discussion
3. **Find maintainers**: Need help managing the project
4. **Build roadmap**: Prioritize based on demand + feasibility
5. **Ship v3.1**: First new feature beyond bypass mode

**Let's do it again. Let's make Anthropic add more features. üöÄ**
